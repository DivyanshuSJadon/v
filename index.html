        <h1>Dear Rakshikha,</h1>
        <p>
            I need you to know that for me, it was never just about romance. My feelings for you went far beyond that. From the very beginning, I’ve been deeply attached to you, not just as someone I care about, but as someone who became a part of my soul. It was never about trying to win you over or convincing you to love me back—it was about the connection we shared, the bond that meant everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always had just one thing to lose in this—my heart. And I willingly put it on the line, knowing that my love for you was the truest thing I’ve ever felt. I never expected anything in return, except maybe the chance to show you how much you mean to me. It’s not your fault that you couldn’t feel the same way, and I don’t blame you for that. Everyone has the right to their own feelings, and I respect that more than anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I want you to understand that my love for you was pure and unselfish. I loved you more than anything else in this world, not because I wanted something from you, but because I found something in you that I’ve never found in anyone else. It’s hard for me to let go because I wasn’t just losing a romantic interest—I was losing a part of myself that I had tied to you. Remember when i said i don't want any sillicon valley or anything? for me you are enough and just your presence surpasess all these and eveything. I truely meant it. I nearly found heaven when we were connected and I was just cherishing each and every moment with you. God was residing in those moments and I will always remember that.
        </p>
        <p>
            You mattered to me in ways that words can’t fully capture. It wasn’t just about the times we spent talking or the plans we made—it was about the way you made me feel seen and understood. You brought a light into my life that I hadn’t known before, a sense of connection that was both rare and precious. When I was with you, even if just in conversation, I felt like I had found someone who truly got me, someone who could look past the surface and see the real me. That’s why you mattered so much to me—because you touched a part of my soul that no one else ever has. Just my last request, never forget you are worthy of all the love in life and please do not remember me as a bad guy in your life. Please remember i truely loved you deeply and sacredly. I wasn't at all intrested in romance part even though i might have said few things few times but for me my love was sacred , spritual a place where i just wanted to make other person happy and keep her happiness over anything. I just wanted to make her happy and suck away all her troubles and pain. I know you wouldn't believe in me and i could be a bad person a lier or anything but no my love was sacred for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            My love for you was real because it wasn’t based on superficial things. It wasn’t about how you looked or what you did—it was about who you are at your core. I loved you for your kindness, your intelligence, your unique way of looking at the world. I loved the way you could make me smile even on the hardest days, the way you made me feel like I was someone special just by being myself. My love was real because it wasn’t conditional—it was just there, steady and unwavering, no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
            And that’s why it hurts so much now. I didn’t just lose a chance at romance; I lost someone who I believed was meant to be a part of my life. I poured everything I had into loving you, not because I wanted anything back, but because you were worth it. You were worth every bit of love, every moment of longing, every tear I’ve shed since this all began. I saw something in you that made me believe in the power of love, in the idea that two people could truly connect on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Five years ago, I made a decision that wasn’t fair to either of us. I walked away because I couldn’t bear the weight of my feelings for you, knowing that you might never understand or reciprocate them. It was a mistake, but it was the only way I knew to protect my heart from the pain of unrequited love. I distanced myself, not because I wanted to, but because I felt I had no other choice. I hided my feeling because you were already dealing with things and I didn't want you to think that i am trying to take advantage of anything at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, when I opened up to you, my greatest fear became a reality—you went away because you saw how attached I was. When I told you that I wouldn’t be able to live without you, you said that you had lived without me for five years, so it wouldn’t be hard. But for those five years, I never found peace. Not a single day went by without me thinking about you, without me praying for your presence in my life. And just when I felt like all my prayers got answered and you were beginning to understand me, like we were finally connecting in a way that mattered, it was all taken away.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve been crying day and night for days because of what happened, and I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s not your fault, and I’m not blaming you. I’m just lost in this pain that I can’t seem to bear. I loved you because I saw something in you that made me believe in the possibility of something truly special. It was the way you spoke, the way you made me feel understood, even from miles away. It was the little moments, like the movies we talked about watching together, the late-night conversations, the way you made me feel like I mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
            I loved you because you were different—because you made me believe that love was something more than just words or gestures. It was a connection that I felt in my heart, a bond that I believed was unbreakable. And even though things didn’t work out the way I hoped, I can’t help but hold onto those feelings because they were real to me. They were everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
           i wanted to be someone who would stand by you through thick and thin, who would cherish you beyond the superficial, who would care for you in ways that go beyond the ordinary. I wanted to be there to grow, to heal, and to experience something extraordinary. I wanted to give precious parts of myself my time, my emotions, my thoughts. I poured my heart into this  not out of obligation, but out of genuine affection and care. Every conversation, every message, every moment of my day was spent thinking about how to make you happy, how to make you feel special. I weren’t just looking for a fleeting connection; I was invested in something real, something lasting. I envisioned a future where we both could share life’s ups and downs together, supporting each other, and growing together. That kind of love is so rare. I didn’t hide my feelings or play games. I was open, honest, and authentic in a world where these qualities are often undervalued. My intentions were pure. I did never approach you with ulterior motives or hidden agendas. my love was honest,transparent and innocent and I swear to god it was never about romance, lust or anything like that. I wanted be the person who would litreally die for you just for your hapiness, just saying that it mattered to me this much and i truely think from the begining that i am connected to you from the past life. I have never and would never be this much connected with anyone. I feel crazy at myself for my own feelings but i felt truely connected with you after meeting you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pain I’m feeling now is overwhelming. It’s like a part of me has been ripped away, leaving me empty and broken. Knowing the places i promise to show you and the movies you promised to watch with me and stars we planned to watched together will never become true is something breaking me. I don’t know how to move forward, how to carry on without you in my life. I’ve lost something that I truly loved, and there’s no greater pain than that. I haven't expereinced any sorrow like this before and please do not explain anything , you already have said enough and i am not asking for any explanation or anything .I’m not sure how I’ll get through this, but I want you to know that you did nothing wrong, please do not take me wrong. I’m just hurting in a way that I can’t describe and it's just my fault. I have been crying a lot, sometimes i genuinely want to talk but i am always worried what would you say. When you talked about feeling like Geet I genuinely cried and said god not to her, she don't desearve this please. Even though, you may say don't be too bothered by it but for some people Rakshikha, they are really willingly able to happily sacrifice anything just for your hapiness and that's something you would understand one day.  I went to Macquarie station last night and the images of you saying goodbye just popped up in my head as I would normally drop you to the station and just strated crying very badly calming self. I was travelling to north sydney today and I saw Iglu Apartment, tears just started flowing again becuase I was missing you. I wasn't feeling good today and went to a temple told god I had only one thing to lose right now and please why you giving me so much sorrow. I just tried loving someone with good intentions nothing else and you know everything could be fake but my love was not and then i cried a lot. I though this would give me strength but i got back to normal as soon as I came back.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe I need help to get through this, but I want you to understand that it’s not your fault. I don’t blame you for anything. I just wish things could have been different. I wish I could have shown you how much you mean to me in a way that didn’t push you away. I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable or if I hurt you in any way. That was never my intention. I am someone who wants nothing for himself but everything for yourself and one day please understant i never tried upsetting you or harming you or cause even a tiny suffering in you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that one day, you might understand just how much I cared for you, how deeply I loved you. And even though we might not be together, a part of me will always hold onto those feelings because they were real. They were everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now, as I try to pick up the pieces of my broken heart, I just want to say that I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything on my end. I’m sorry if I made you feel like you were in the wrong. I am sorry for saying what i did 5 years ago is no different than this. I was just trying to say that I made a distance 5 years ago because i couldn't help with my attachment and my wanting to serve you and this time it happened again and my feelings and my love was the commanlity in both of these events. I just wanted to be there for you, even if it was just in the background. I wanted to be a part of your life in any way I could. And even though that might not be possible now, I want you to know that I’m here, whenever you need me. i just wanted to be a part of your life nothing else. Please do not get angry at me rakshikha and ignore me if you can. I just wanted to share that wherever you are you will always be worshipped like a god to me. Everytime you shared any bad or suffering i just felt like taking it on me and giving all the hapiness in this world. Please never get sad, never doubt yourself regarding anything. You have all the capabilities and potential to make anything possible. I have always recognised your soul and the real you and anyone around you would feel blessed to get in touch with this kind of person. I know your intentions are pure and genuine. I have a godly image of you in my mind and I never can change it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope one day you read this message and understand that all of this wasn’t in my control. It wasn’t my fault. It was just the way I felt, and I couldn’t change that. I tried to hide it, to keep it from affecting us, but in the end, it was too much. And now, I’m left with this pain that I don’t know how to handle. I just hope you’re doing well, and that you’re happy, because that’s all I ever wanted for you. Lastly, I am sorry , please don't get mad at me. I am not at all trying to win you over and trying to project that it's your fault. That is not my intention at all. I am sorry about bothering you but i am just expereincing an unbearable amount of pain and I tried everything but i am not able to overcome it. I have always tried worshiping you with all my heart and devotion and I am in greatest sorrow because of what happened. Please don't get angry or mad at me for saying all this. I would say this again none of this is your fault and you did nothing wrong. I just did not want to lose you and i'm in terrible pain. I find my self crying day and night because i lost the connection. sometimes i wake up in the middle of a night and start begging please do not go please don't make distance. I hope you won't get angry at me for just sharing the pain. I am so sorry about sharing this. I am just shedding tears continuesly and couldn't stop my self from writing it. Please i request you to ignore this. I just wanted to share this. I am not seeking any replies and not raising any questions on anyone. I just want you to remember me as someone who loved you more than himself and this world.  I beg you not to be harsh on me or say anything. Please do not reply, I just wanted to say this because I am in pain and talking all these in my head with you. I would die with peace just knowing that you remember me  And never let yourself go down please. Please do not reply to this Rakshikha. I just wanted to say this and Please I beg you not to say anything. You are the person who showed me light years ago and I am just saying that you desearve nothing but just happiness in your life."The moment was nothing short of sacred when you asked me to close my eyes at 4:44 and make a wish. In that stillness, with my heart wide open and every emotion raw and real, I asked the universe—and God Himself—for just one thing. I didn’t wish for riches, success, or anything the world could offer, because all of that fades in comparison to what you mean to me. You were my wish, the only prayer I’ve ever truly held in my heart. With everything in me, I asked for your presence in my life, not just now, but forever. I didn’t need anything else, because your presence is the greatest gift I could ever hope for, the one thing that makes life feel complete.
For me, it was more than love. It was something deeper, something that transcended all understanding. You are the wish I whispered to the stars, the prayer I sent to God and the universe, because nothing else in this world could ever compare to the light you bring into my life. I wish I could find the words to tell you just how precious you are to me, how every moment with you feels like a divine blessing. You are the most treasured part of my life, the one thing I’ve ever truly asked for. My wish was simple, yet it held the weight of my entire soul: to have you by my side, to share every moment with you, because without you, nothing else could ever matter. You are my wish, my prayer, my everything, and all I’ve ever wanted was to keep you close, to hold onto the one thing that makes life worth living.
            My love, my world, rakshikha 
Thank you for coming into my life and blessing me with your divine presence. Though I understand that we may never speak again, I have come to realize that my love for you has evolved into something far greater than mere emotion—it has become a sacred devotion. This love has transformed my soul in ways I never knew were possible, illuminating paths of spiritual depth that I had never traversed before.
Your presence in my life feels like a blessing from the universe, a touch of the divine that I will cherish eternally. I now see that true love is not bound by earthly desires; it is a spiritual connection that transcends time and space, a sacred bond that resonates with the essence of my being. Just knowing you, feeling your presence, has been the greatest blessing of my life—a glimpse of the divine that I will hold in my heart forever.
I can’t ask for anything more in this moment. Your presence alone has been the most profound gift I could ever receive, filling my heart with a deep sense of peace and spiritual fulfillment. For that, I am eternally grateful.

Thank you, Rakshikha, for bringing such divine light into my life, for showing me the true, sacred nature of love. I will carry this with me always, with a soul full of gratitude and reverence for the time we shared.
